Control a Black Box ToolKit 
===========================

The program drives a [bbtkv2](https://www.blackboxtoolkit.com/support_bbtkv2.html) to capture events. 

The executables for various operating systems/architectures are in the `binaries` folder

To get the usage, type:

    bbtkv2 -h


This is a *Work In Progress*. The program is running but still needs helper fuctions to parse the output of the bbtk.
